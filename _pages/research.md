My research sits at the interface between control engineering, informatics and robotics, which focuses on developing innovative algorithms and systematic solutions to Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS). With an inspiration to advance their applications in different domains, there is a diverse range of sectors that my research can contribute to, ranging from transport, agriculture, energy to defence and security.

## Control for vehicle/robot dynamics

We aim to advance the control design for vehicles and robots with complicated dynamics and to improve their robustness and performance in adverse conditions. We developed various disturbance observer based control (DOBC) techniques to compensate uncertainties and disturbances, and continue to integrate them with other methods to achieve safety-critial control in dynamic environment.

## Planning for autonomous missions

Having worked on some path planning solutions for UAVs, my recent focus is about informative path planning for environment monitoring. It can be regarded as a paradigm of “planning for data”, where robotic systems under information-driven control are able to take appropriate actions to interrogate the environment for more informative data or useful feedback. We have had a lot of success in applying this kind of framework in autonomous search of unknown chemical, biological, radiological (CBR) releases.

## Percetion and information fusion 
We are interested in fusing different sensor information and 'world knowledge' to achieve two primary goals: 1) to establish a better situational awareness for robotic systems operated in a dynamic environment, inlcuding tracking other objects in the environment; 2) to find an effective way to represent and understand environmental features, such as mapping crop disease or chemical gas distributions, based on the data collected by robotic systems.
