My research sits at the interface between control engineering, informatics and robotics, which focuses on developing innovative algorithms and systematic solutions to Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS). With an inspiration to advance their applications in different domains, there is a diverse range of sectors that my research can contribute to, ranging from transport, agriculture, energy to defence and security.

## Control for vehicle/robot dynamics 
![image](/images/dobc_diagram.png){: style="float: left; margin-right: 0.5em;"} 
We aim to advance the control design for vehicles and robots with complicated dynamics and to improve their robustness and performance in adverse conditions. We developed various disturbance observer based control (DOBC) techniques to compensate uncertainties and disturbances, and continue to integrate them with other methods to achieve safety-critial control in dynamic environment.

## Percetion and information fusion 
We are interested in fusing different sensor information and "world knowledge" to 1) establish a better situational awarenes for robotic systems operated in a dynamical environemnt and 2) find an effective way to represent and understand environment features (e.g., mapping crop disease, chemical gas distributions) based on the data collected by robotic systems.  

We are interested in fusing different sensor information and 'world knowledge' to achieve two primary goals: 1) to establish a better situational awareness for robotic systems operated in a dynamic environment; 2) to find an effective way to represent and understand environmental features, such as mapping crop disease or chemical gas distributions, based on the data collected by robotic systems.
