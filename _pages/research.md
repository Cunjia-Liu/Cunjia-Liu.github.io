My research sits at the interface between control engineering, informatics and robotics, which focuses on developing innovative algorithms and systematic solutions to Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS). With an inspiration to advance their applications in different domains, there is a diverse range of sectors that my research can contribute to, ranging from transport, agriculture, energy to defence and security.

## Control for vehicle/robot dynamics

We aim to advance the control design for systems with complicated dynamics and to improve their robustness and performance in adverse conditions. We developed various disturbance observer based control (DOBC) techniques to compensate uncertainties and disturbances, and continue to integrate them with other methods to achieve safety-critial control.
