I am a Reader in Unmanned Vehicles at the [Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/aae/) (AAE) at Loughborough University. 

I received my PhD in autonomous aerial vehicles from the same department in 2011. After completing my PhD,  I worked at Triumph Actuation & Motion Control Systems-UK Ltd briefly as a control engineer before returned to the Autonomous System Laboratory at Loughborough University as a Research Associate, where I was appointed as an academic in 2013. 

Prior to joining Loughborough University, I obtained my MSc in Guidance, Navigation and Control (in 2008) and BEng in Control Engineering (in 2005) both from Beihang University (BUAA), China. 

### My research interests include:
* Control engineering: Model predictive control, Disturbance observer based control
* Information fusion: Bayesian estimation, Data assimilation, Sensor management
* Autonomous robotics: Flight control and planning, Robotic perception
* Application domain: Smart farming, CBRN defence, Infrastructure inspection, Intelligent mobility
