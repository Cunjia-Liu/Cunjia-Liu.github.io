I am currently a Professor of Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the [Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/aae/) (AAE) at Loughborough University, working with [Loughborough University Centre for Autonomous Systems](https://sites.google.com/a/lucasresearch.co.uk/lucas-research/home) (LUCAS).

I earned my PhD in autonomous aerial vehicles from the same department in 2011. After completing my PhD,  I worked briefly at Triumph Actuation & Motion Control Systems-UK Ltd as a control engineer, and then returned to LUCAS as a Research Associate. I joined the Department of AAE as an academic in 2013. 

Prior to joining Loughborough University, I obtained my MSc in Guidance, Navigation and Control (in 2008) and BEng in Control Engineering (in 2005) both from Beihang University (BUAA), China. 

My research focuses on Robotics and Autonomous Systems, with the primary goal of developing advanced functionalities to facilitate and enhance their applications across various domains. I have gained extensive expereince from supervising approximately 10 PhD students and working with 8 Postdoctoral Research Associates (PDRAs) in conducting high-quality research. Throughout my career, I have consistently attracted and successfully delivered multi-million pound [research projects](/projects) in the field of robotics and autonomous systems.
