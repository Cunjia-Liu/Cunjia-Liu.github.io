I am a Reader in Unmanned Vehicles at the [Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/aae/) (AAE) at Loughborough University. 

I received my PhD in autonomous aerial vehicles from the same department in 2011. After completing my PhD,  I worked briefly at Triumph Actuation & Motion Control Systems-UK Ltd as a control engineer, and then returned to the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at Loughborough University as a Research Associate. I joined the department as an academic in 2013. 

Prior to joining Loughborough University, I obtained my MSc in Guidance, Navigation and Control (in 2008) and BEng in Control Engineering (in 2005) both from Beihang University (BUAA), China. 

My research encompasses Robotics and Autonomous Systems with the aim to develop advanced functionalities to enable and promot their applications in differet domains. In particular, I am interested in developing and combining techniqiues from control engineering (e.g., Model predictive control, Disturbance observer based control), information fusion (e.g., particle filtering, Monte Carlo methods) and machine learning to provide solutions to flight control, path planning, target tracking, sensor management and robotic information gathering.

### News: 
-<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/May-2023-lightgrey" align="top"> A new PDRA position is opening soon for an agriculture/horticulture robotics project focusing on perception and SLAM solutions (funded by UKRI). The post will likely start from September 2023 for 30-36 months. Please contact me if you are interested.
