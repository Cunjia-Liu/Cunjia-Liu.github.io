I am a Reader in the Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering (AAE) at Loughborough University. I received my PhD in autonomous aerial vehicles from the same department in 2011. After completing PhD,  I worked at Triumph Actuation & Motion Control Systems-UK Ltd briefly as a control engineer and then returned to the Autonomous System Laboratory at Loughborough University as a Research Associate. I was appointed as a Lecturer in Unmanned Vehicles, or Flight Dynamics and Control in October 2013 and promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2018 and Reader in 2020. Prior to joining Loughborough University, I obtained my MSc in Guidance, Navigation and Control (in 2008) and BEng in Control Engineering (in 2005) both from Beihang University (BUAA), China.
